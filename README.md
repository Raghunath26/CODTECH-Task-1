Objective:
The primary objective of the simple calculator project is to create a basic application that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project aims to help developers understand the fundamental concepts of application development, including user interface design, event handling, and basic arithmetic logic implementation.

Key Activities:

1.Project Planning and Design:
  Define the scope and requirements of the calculator.
  Design the user interface (UI) layout.

2.Setting Up the Development Environment:
  Install necessary software and tools (e.g., IDE, compilers, libraries).

3.User Interface Development:
  Create the UI components such as buttons, display screen, and layout.
  Arrange buttons for numbers (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /).

4.Event Handling:
  Implement event listeners for button clicks.
  Capture user inputs and display them on the screen.

5.Arithmetic Logic Implementation:
  Develop functions to handle arithmetic operations.
  Ensure correct order of operations (e.g., multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).

6.Testing and Debugging:
  Test the calculator for various input scenarios.
  Debug and fix any issues or bugs.

7.User Experience Improvement:
  Add additional features such as a clear button, decimal point, and handling division by zero.

8.Documentation:
  Document the code and create user manuals or guides.


Technologies Used:

1.Programming Languages:
  HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface (for web-based calculators).
  JavaScript: For implementing the logic and event handling in web-based calculators.
  Java/Kotlin: For Android-based calculators.
  Swift: For iOS-based calculators.
  Python: For console-based or GUI-based calculators using libraries like Tkinter.
  
2.Development Tools:
  IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Such as Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, Android Studio, Xcode.
  Version Control System: Git for version control and collaboration.
  
3.Libraries/Frameworks:
  Bootstrap: For responsive web design (optional).
  Tkinter: For Python GUI applications.
  React/Vue.js: For more advanced web-based calculators (optional).
  
4.Testing Tools:
  Unit Testing Frameworks: Such as Jest for JavaScript, JUnit for Java, XCTest for Swift.
